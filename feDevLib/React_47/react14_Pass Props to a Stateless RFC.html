DESCRIPTION

Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component
The previous challenges covered a lot about creating and composing JSX elements, functional components, and ES6 style class components in React. With this foundation, it's time to look at another feature very common in React: props. In React, you can pass props, or properties, to child components. Say you have an App component which renders a child component called Welcome which is a stateless functional component. You can pass Welcome a user property by writing:

<App>
  <Welcome user='Mark' />
</App>
You use custom HTML attributes created by you and supported by React to be passed to the component. In this case, the created property user is passed to the component Welcome. Since Welcome is a stateless functional component, it has access to this value like so:

const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.user}!</h1>
It is standard to call this value props and when dealing with stateless functional components, you basically consider it as an argument to a function which returns JSX. You can access the value of the argument in the function body. With class components, you will see this is a little different.

There are Calendar and CurrentDate components in the code editor. When rendering CurrentDate from the Calendar component, pass in a property of date assigned to the current date from JavaScript's Date object. Then access this prop in the CurrentDate component, showing its value within the p tags. Note that for prop values to be evaluated as JavaScript, they must be enclosed in curly brackets, for instance date={Date()}.



==================================================================
TESTCASE

The Calendar component should return a single div element.

The second child of the Calendar component should be the CurrentDate component.

The CurrentDate component should have a prop called date.

The date prop of the CurrentDate should contain a string of text.

The date prop should be generated by calling Date()

The CurrentDate component should render the value from the date prop in the p tag.

==================================================================
SETUP

const CurrentDate = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      { /* Change code below this line */ }
      <p>The current date is: </p>
      { /* Change code above this line */ }
    </div>
  );
};

class Calendar extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>What date is it?</h3>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <CurrentDate />
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
