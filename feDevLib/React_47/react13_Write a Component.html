DESCRIPTION

Write a React Component from Scratch
Now that you've learned the basics of JSX and React components, it's time to write a component on your own. React components are the core building blocks of React applications so it's important to become very familiar with writing them. Remember, a typical React component is an ES6 class which extends React.Component. It has a render method that returns HTML (from JSX) or null. This is the basic form of a React component. Once you understand this well, you will be prepared to start building more complex React projects.

Define a class MyComponent that extends React.Component. Its render method should return a div that contains an h1 tag with the text: My First React Component! in it. Use this text exactly, the case and punctuation matter. Make sure to call the constructor for your component, too.

Render this component to the DOM using ReactDOM.render(). There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to use.

==================================================================
TESTCASE

There should be a React component called MyComponent.

MyComponent should contain an h1 tag with text My First React Component! Case and punctuation matter.

MyComponent should render to the DOM.

MyComponent should have a constructor calling super with props.
