DESCRIPTION

Change the Presentation of a Bar Chart
The last challenge created a bar chart, but there are a couple of formatting changes that could improve it:

Add space between each bar to visually separate them, which is done by adding a margin to the CSS for the bar class

Increase the height of the bars to better show the difference in values, which is done by multiplying the value by a number to scale the height

First, add a margin of 2px to the bar class in the style tag. Next, change the callback function in the style() method so it returns a value 10 times the original data value (plus the px).

Note: Multiplying each data point by the same constant only alters the scale. It's like zooming in, and it doesn't change the meaning of the underlying data.



==================================================================
TESTCASE

The first div should have a height of 120 pixels and a margin of 2 pixels.

The second div should have a height of 310 pixels and a margin of 2 pixels.

The third div should have a height of 220 pixels and a margin of 2 pixels.

The fourth div should have a height of 170 pixels and a margin of 2 pixels.

The fifth div should have a height of 250 pixels and a margin of 2 pixels.

The sixth div should have a height of 180 pixels and a margin of 2 pixels.

The seventh div should have a height of 290 pixels and a margin of 2 pixels.

The eighth div should have a height of 140 pixels and a margin of 2 pixels.

The ninth div should have a height of 90 pixels and a margin of 2 pixels.

<style>
  .bar {
    width: 25px;
    height: 100px;

    /* Add your code above this line */
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: blue;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    d3.select("body").selectAll("div")
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append("div")
      .attr("class", "bar")
      .style("height", (d) => (d + "px")) // Change this line
  </script>
</body>
